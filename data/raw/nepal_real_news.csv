"Formal campaigning begins for March 5 Parliamentary Elections","Representational graphic. Image: Freepik/ pch.vector Kathmandu, February 16 Formal campaigning for the House of Representatives Elections , scheduled for March 5, begins today. Under election law, rallies, mass gatherings, corner meetings and the publication or broadcast of election-related materials in the media are permitted only from 15 days before polling day. Accordingly, political parties and candidates may campaign from today, February, until midnight on March 2. The Election Commission said parties, candidates and other stakeholders may formally seek votes from the public, provided they fully comply with the election code of conduct. Parties and candidates may also run advertisements in newspapers and online media in line with prescribed standards. However, when organising mass or corner meetings, candidates must submit details of expenses incurred for stage setup to the relevant election office, either personally or through a representative. The Commission said it has mobilised various mechanisms to implement and monitor compliance with the code of conduct. It stated that it may issue letters seeking clarification in cases of alleged violations and aims to avoid situations that would require legal action. The Commission also recalled that the code of conduct was drafted after extensive consultations with political parties and other stakeholders, all of whom have pledged to abide by it. Acting Chief Election Commissioner Ram Prasad Bhandari said the Commission has adopted a zero-tolerance policy toward violations of the code.

"Nepal Army rejects claims over US Military parade in Kathmandu","Kathmandu, February 16 A photograph purporting to show the United States Army staging a parade at Tundikhel went viral on social media, stirring debate just weeks before Nepal’s parliamentary elections. The image, shared widely online around the time of Nepal’s Army Day and the Hindu festival of Maha Shivaratri, prompted questions about the nature of American military presence in the country. In response, Nepal’s Army Headquarters urged the public not to be misled, describing the event as a routine and reciprocal engagement between friendly militaries. “At the ceremony held annually on Army Day in Nepal, military band teams from other countries regularly participate as a gesture of friendship. We also send our own military contingents abroad,” Brig. Gen. Rajaram Basnet, spokesperson for the Nepali Army , said to Onlinekhabar . “Just recently, a Nepali band took part in India’s Army Day in a similar manner, and the announcements there were made in Nepali. Participation in various programs and joint exercises under army-to-army cooperation is a regular process.” Basnet added that the Army had also clarified the matter in an official statement. Beyond ceremonial exchanges, he said, Nepal participates in youth exchange programs and other forms of military cooperation. Nepal and the United States have maintained military ties since 1947. Successive governments in Nepal’s republican era have continued the practice of hosting foreign military bands during Army Day celebrations. Many Nepali Army officers attend staff colleges in the United States for training and education, while American personnel visit Nepal for official engagements. Nepal also conducts joint military exercises, both at home and abroad, with countries including India, China, the United States, Britain and Pakistan. The Army said such activities are conducted regularly, as in the past. With just over two weeks remaining before Nepal’s general elections, the American military band’s appearance has become a subject of partisan debate. One side has claimed that Western powers are backing a recent Gen Z–led protest movement and has portrayed the performance as part of that broader influence. Government and military officials, however, have dismissed such assertions, urging the public not to spread misinformation and describing the event as a continuation of a longstanding practice. Officials close to the government noted that similar engagements took place during the tenures of former prime ministers K.P. Sharma Oli, Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Sher Bahadur Deuba, and appealed to political actors not to turn routine military cooperation into election politics.

"Exercise as medicine for Nepal’s ageing brain","Photo by Anupam Mahapatra on Unsplash When most people think about exercise, they think about weight loss, stronger muscles, or heart health. Very few stop to think about the brain. Yet movement may be one of the simplest and most powerful ways to protect our minds as we grow older. This matters now more than ever. Neurological and mental health conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, dementia, depression, and anxiety are rising across the world, including in Nepal. According to the World Health Organization’s 2023 estimates, more than 55 million people globally are living with dementia, and that number is expected to increase sharply as populations age. At the same time, global disease burden analyses published in 2019 and updated in 2021 show that depression and anxiety are among the leading causes of disability worldwide. In Nepal, where access to specialised neurological and mental health care remains limited, protecting brain health through everyday habits is becoming a public health necessity rather than a personal choice. To understand why exercise matters, it helps to look inside the brain itself. Understanding the brain The brain relies on chemical messengers to allow its cells to communicate. One of the most important things is dopamine, which plays a central role in movement, motivation, and learning. In Parkinson’s disease, dopamine-producing brain cells gradually stop functioning, leading to tremor, stiffness, and slowed movement. Research in neuroscience and clinical medicine over the past two decades has consistently shown that regular physical activity supports dopamine signalling and helps preserve motor circuits. Influential studies by neurologists such as Michael Ahlskog in 2011 and follow-up clinical research by Jay Alberts and colleagues in 2013 and 2016 helped establish exercise as a core component of Parkinson’s care rather than just a lifestyle recommendation. Beyond dopamine, movement benefits the brain in other important ways. When we walk, stretch, or engage in physical work, the heart pumps more efficiently and delivers oxygen and nutrients to brain cells. Large population studies published between 2014 and 2020, including long-term cohort studies in Europe and North America, have shown that people who remain physically active have a significantly lower risk of cognitive decline and dementia compared to those who live sedentary lives. A major international review published by the Lancet Commission in 2020 reported that maintaining an active lifestyle is associated with roughly a 20 to 30 per cent reduction in dementia risk. Exercise also triggers the release of protective substances in the brain known as growth factors. One of the most important is brain-derived neurotrophic factor, often described as nourishment for brain cells. Early experimental work in the early 2000s, followed by human brain imaging studies led by Arthur Kramer and colleagues in 2011, showed that this molecule helps brain cells survive, form new connections, and adapt to stress. Higher levels of this factor have been consistently linked to better learning, emotional balance, and mental resilience. Among all lifestyle choices studied so far, regular physical activity remains one of the most reliable ways to naturally increase this protective signal. Another often overlooked benefit of exercise is its effect on inflammation and sleep. Research published between 2015 and 2018 increasingly linked chronic low-grade inflammation to neurodegenerative disease, depression, and age-related cognitive decline. At the same time, sleep research during the same period demonstrated that physical activity improves sleep quality and efficiency, allowing the brain to clear waste products that accumulate during waking hours. These findings helped strengthen the understanding that good sleep is not a luxury for brain health. It is essential. Connection of physical activities and the brain What makes exercise especially powerful is how accessible it is. It does not need to be intense, expensive, or gym-based. Walking in the neighbourhood, cycling, yoga, dancing, farming activities, household work, and active commuting all support brain health. Large clinical trials and systematic reviews published in major medical journals between 2019 and 2024 have shown that even moderate physical activity, when done regularly, reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety and improves overall mental well-being. Studies conducted in Nepal and published through NepJOL between 2017 and 2022 have also reported positive links between physical activity, reduced stress, and better quality of life among students and older adults. For people already living with neurological conditions, exercise offers more than prevention. Clinical studies in Parkinson’s disease published over the last decade show improvements in balance, confidence, mood, and independence in daily life with regular movement. Similar benefits have been reported in studies of older adults at risk of memory problems and in people experiencing chronic stress or depression. Across these studies, movement consistently restores a sense of control and dignity that illness often takes away. In a country like Nepal, exercise represents a powerful and practical public health tool. It costs little, requires no prescription, and can be adapted to any age or ability. Public health research and policy discussions over the past decade increasingly emphasised the role of safe walking spaces, community parks, yoga programs, and public awareness campaigns in protecting brain health at the population level. Encouraging movement is not just an individual&#8217;s responsibility. It is a collective investment in national well-being. Overall, exercise is not only about staying fit. It is about keeping the brain active, adaptable, and resilient. In that sense, movement is more than a habit. It is daily medicine for the brain, taken step by step.

"Nepal’s World Cup ends with a heavy defeat to West Indies","Nepal’s campaign at the 2026 ICC T20 World Cup ended Saturday with a decisive nine-wicket loss to the two-time champions West Indies, a result that eliminated the team from the tournament at the group stage. This was Nepal&#8217;s third consecutive loss. Previously, they lost to England and Italy in Group C. West Indies, by contrast, remained unbeaten with three straight victories and became the first team from the group to advance to the Super Eight round. With six points, West Indies sit atop the standings. England, with two wins and one loss, is second with four points. Scotland and Italy have two points each. England will secure a place in the Super Eight with a win over Italy, while Italy must win both of its remaining matches to progress. Nepal , still without a point, will play Scotland on Tuesday in its final match of the tournament, now a contest for pride rather than qualification. At Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, Nepal posted 133 for 8 after being sent in to bat. The total proved insufficient against a West Indies lineup that reached 134 for 1 in 15.2 overs. Captain Shai Hope led the chase with an unbeaten 61 off 44 balls, striking five fours and three sixes. Shimron Hetmyer added 46 not out, and together the pair shared an unbroken 91-run partnership for the second wicket that effectively sealed the match. Brandon King contributed 22 in a 43-run opening stand with Hope. Nepal’s only wicket came from Nandan Yadav. Nepal’s innings was built largely around a half-century from Vice Captain Dipendra Singh Airee, who scored 58 off 47 balls, including three fours and three sixes. Airee reached his fifty in the 19th over and became only the second Nepali batter to score a half-century in a T20 World Cup, after Subash Khakurel in 2014. Sompal Kami, appearing in his first match of this year’s tournament, made an unbeaten 26 off 15 balls. His 54-run partnership with Airee for the seventh wicket was Nepal’s highest of the innings and helped lift the team to a competitive total after early setbacks. Nepal struggled in the powerplay, managing just 22 runs for the loss of three wickets in the first six overs, the team’s lowest powerplay score in T20 World Cup history. Kushal Bhurtel was bowled in the opening over by Akeal Hosein, and the middle order faltered soon after, leaving Nepal at 46 for 5 before Airee and his lower-order partners stabilised the innings. Jason Holder led the West Indies bowling attack with four wickets, while Hosein, Matthew Forde, Shamar Joseph and Roston Chase took one each. The match also marked a milestone for Sompal Kami, who became the first Nepali cricketer to appear in three T20 World Cups, having featured in Nepal’s debut tournament in 2014 and in the two editions since. He now holds the national record for most T20 World Cup appearances, with seven matches. Among the 15 members of Nepal’s squad, Sundeep Jora and all-rounder Bashir Ahamad are the only players yet to appear in this year’s tournament.

"Nepal under pressure as West Indies eye Super 8 spot","Mumbai, February 15 Nepal will face the West Indies on Sunday in its third group-stage match of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 . The game is set to begin at 11:15 a.m. local time at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium. Having lost its first two matches, Nepal enters the contest under mounting pressure; the remaining fixtures are must-wins if it hopes to stay in contention. The West Indies, by contrast, arrive buoyed by consecutive victories and stand on the brink of advancing to the Super 8 round. A win over Nepal would seal the West Indies’ place in the Super 8 and eliminate Nepal with a game to spare. Even two victories may not suffice for Nepal, which would still need other results to break in its favour. At a pre-match press conference on Saturday, Nepal’s head coach, Stuart Law, acknowledged the formidable quality of the opposition and the level of performance required. “We have to think only about winning the remaining two games,” he said. “Otherwise, we may as well pack our bags and go home.” Coach Law reflected on the contrasting nature of Nepal’s opening defeats and emphasised the need to close the gap exposed in those matches. His pointed remarks about players’ use of social media have also stirred discussion in recent days. West Indies spinner Akeal Hosein said his side was well aware of Nepal’s capabilities and would approach the encounter as it would any other World Cup fixture. Asked about the difference between the Nepali team that played a T20 International series in Sharjah last September and the one competing now at the World Cup, Hosein replied, “We know what Nepal are capable of and what they can do.” The West Indies are two-time T20 World Cup champions, having lifted the trophy in 2012 and 2016. Currently ranked seventh in the ICC T20I standings and captained by Shai Hope, they are known for their explosive power-hitting. Nepal and the West Indies have met three times in T20 Internationals, with Nepal winning two and losing one. In a historic series last October, Nepal secured a 2–1 series victory over the West Indies.

"A look at Nepal’s player performances in the World Cup","Mumbai, February 18  
 Nepal  exited  from the group stage once again while playing the  ICC T20 World Cup  for the third time. After losing the first three matches consecutively, Nepal was confirmed to be out of the group stage, but on Tuesday, they secured a consolation victory by defeating Scotland by 7 wickets. 
 Although Nepal had set a target of reaching the Super 8, consecutive defeats in the opening matches meant that the goal could not be achieved this time. Nepal’s performance in both batting and bowling was weak in the initial games. However, in the fourth match against Scotland, Nepal showed improvement and registered their first World Cup win in 12 years. Sompal Kami shone in bowling, while Dipendra Singh Airee, Kushal Bhurtel, Aasif Sheikh, and Gulshan Jha contributed with the bat. 
  Although Nepal failed to reach the Super 8, winning one match brought relief to some extent. 
 Along with Dipendra, players like Sompal Kami and Sher Malla achieved individual milestones. However, the Nepali team could not perform according to their potential on a stage as big as the World Cup. 
 Out of the 15-member squad, 14 players got the opportunity to play in this World Cup. Aarif Sheikh, Sher Malla, Lalit Rajbanshi, Lokesh Bam, and Nandan Yadav made their T20 World Cup debuts. 
 Here is an overall analysis of the performances of Nepali players: 
 Rohit Paudel 
 
 Rohit Kumar Paudel is the captain under whom Nepal played the T20 World Cup twice. Under his leadership, Nepal qualified for the tournament on both occasions. Though he has built an image as a successful captain in Nepali cricket, his record in the T20 World Cup has not been impressive. 
 Nepal had lost six consecutive World Cup matches under his captaincy. While Rohit holds the record for captaining Nepal in the most T20 World Cup matches, the performance did not match expectations. His own performance as team leader was also below expectations this time. Rohit lacked consistency with the bat, scoring 83 runs in four matches. 
 He scored 39 against England in the first match, showing promise, but failed to perform in the subsequent games. He scored 23 against Italy, 5 against the West Indies, and 16 against Scotland. Against Scotland, he also bowled 2 overs, conceding 12 runs and taking 1 wicket, providing a breakthrough after Scotland’s aggressive start. 
 Dipendra Singh Airee 
 
 For vice-captain Dipendra Singh Airee, this World Cup became memorable. Promoted to number four, he played as Nepal’s key all-rounder. Most importantly, he scored Nepal’s first T20 World Cup half-century in 12 years. 
 He became the second Nepali player to score a World Cup half-century. His 58 against West Indies is the highest individual score by a Nepali player in a World Cup. Previously, in 2014, opener Subash Khakurel had scored 56 in Nepal’s debut T20 World Cup in Bangladesh. 
 Dipendra also played a key role in Nepal’s win against Scotland, scoring an unbeaten 50 as Nepal secured its first win in 12 years.  
 He was the first Nepali to score 100 runs in this edition and is now Nepal’s highest run-scorer in T20 World Cups. He scored 44 against England, 17 against Italy, 58 against the West Indies, and 50* against Scotland, totalling 169 runs in four matches. He also took 2 wickets. 
 Kushal Bhurtel 
 
 Nepal’s weak batting was partly due to the openers failing in the first three matches. Bhurtel scored 78 runs in four matches. 
 He made 29 against England but then scored only 5 and 1 in the next two matches. In the fourth match, he returned to form with an aggressive 43 off 35 balls, hitting 1 four and 4 sixes. 
 Aasif Sheikh 
 
 The other opener, Aasif Sheikh, had a similar experience. He scored 71 runs in four matches. 
 He made 7 against England, 20 against Italy, 11 against the West Indies, and 33 against Scotland. Behind the stumps, he was not very impactful, taking just one catch each against England and Scotland. 
 Aarif Sheikh 
 
 Known mainly as an ODI player, Aarif has recently improved in T20S. After strong performances in qualifiers and the Nepal Premier League, he earned his first T20 World Cup call-up. Batting at number five, he scored 10 against England, 27 against Italy (Nepal’s highest individual score in that match), and 2 against the West Indies. 
 Lokesh Bam 
 
 Making his debut in this edition, Lokesh impressed with an unbeaten 39 against England (4 fours, 2 sixes), including consecutive sixes off Jofra Archer. However, he managed only 3 against Italy and 13 against the West Indies.  
 Gulshan Jha 
 
 There were high expectations from Gulshan Jha, but batting at number seven, he could not meet them. Despite his pace and height, he did not bowl in the tournament. He scored 3, 1, and 11 in the first three matches. Against Scotland, promoted to number five, he scored an unbeaten 24 in partnership with Dipendra. As Nepal’s only left-handed batter, his overall performance was disappointing. 
 Sandeep Lamichhane 
 
 Expectations were high from Sandeep Lamichhane, who was playing his second World Cup and had vast franchise experience worldwide. However, he managed only 1 wicket in four matches. 
 He took 1/25 against England but went wicketless against Italy, the West Indies, and Scotland. He also scored 5 runs against Italy. His performance did not reflect his experience on the big stage. 
 Nandan Yadav 
 
 Medium pacer Nandan Yadav made his World Cup debut and played all four matches, taking 5 wickets. 
 He took 2 wickets against England, 1 against West Indies, and 2 against Scotland. However, he did not always complete his full quota of overs. 
 Karan KC 
 
 Experienced pacer Karan KC had a forgettable tournament. Having played two T20 World Cups, he remains wicketless in the tournament’s history. 
 He conceded runs in all matches but did contribute 20 runs with the bat across three games. 
 Sompal Kami 
 
 The most experienced player in the squad, Sompal Kami, became the only Nepali to play in three T20 World Cups. His tournament was mixed but improved toward the end. 
 He scored an unbeaten 26 against West Indies and then took 3/25 against Scotland, including three wickets in the death overs. 
 Lalit Rajbanshi 
 
 Spinner Lalit played only one match, against Italy, where he conceded 19 runs in one over without taking a wicket. Though part of the 2024 squad, he did not play then either. 
 Sher Malla 
 
 Spinner Sher Malla made his debut against England and took Phil Salt’s wicket on his very first ball. However, he conceded 35 runs in 3 overs and did not get further opportunities. 
 Sundeep Jora 
 
 Sandeep Jora, playing his second T20 World Cup, got only one match this edition as well, against Scotland. 
 Basir Ahmad 
 
 All-rounder Basir Ahmad, selected after a strong performance in the NPL, however, he did not get a chance to play and remained on the bench throughout.

 On  February 3, 2026, a very disturbing incident happened in Imadol, Lalitpur. A 60-year-old woman accidentally drank acid after thinking it was water. The acid had been stored and sold in a bottle that looked exactly like a normal mineral water bottle. What looked like simple drinking water almost took her life. I was an eyewitness to this incident. She was rushed to the Hospital, where doctors treated her immediately and saved her life. Thankfully, she survived. However, this incident should not be ignored. It was not merely an accident but something that could have been prevented. 
 Sadly, this is not the first such incident in Nepal, as in March 2021 three children, a 16-year-old girl, an 11-year-old boy, and a 9-year-old boy, were severely injured in Sankhu, Kathmandu, after acid stored in a jar was accidentally thrown during a water-throwing festival when it was mistaken for water, causing innocent children to suffer due to careless storage. 
 These incidents show a serious problem in our system. Acid is commonly used in battery repair shops, small industries, workshops, and even in some households. Because it has practical uses, it is easily available in local markets at a low cost. The problem is not that acid exists, but how it is stored and sold. When such a dangerous chemical is kept in bottles that look like drinking water, confusion is bound to happen. In a country where people already worry about safe drinking water, selling acid in water-like bottles is extremely risky. 
 The physical damage caused by acid is severe and immediate. If swallowed, acid can burn the mouth, throat, and stomach within seconds. It can cause internal bleeding, organ damage, permanent scars, and long-term health complications. In many cases, victims may need surgeries, long hospital stays, and lifelong medical care. Some people lose the ability to eat or speak properly. Even if a person survives, their health may never fully return to normal. A single mistake can change someone’s body forever. 
 Beyond physical injury, the mental and emotional impact can be just as serious. A survivor may develop constant fear and anxiety. Simple daily actions, like drinking water, may trigger panic. Some people may experience nightmares, stress, or symptoms of trauma. They may lose confidence and feel unsafe in their own environment. Family members also suffer. They may experience guilt, shock, and long-term emotional distress. On top of this, there is financial stress from medical bills and treatment. These psychological wounds can last for years.  
 Around the world, unsafe storage of chemicals is a major cause of accidental poisoning, especially among children and elderly people. Studies show that proper labelling, child-proof containers, and strict rules greatly reduce such accidents. Nepal must treat chemical packaging as a public safety issue. This is not just a business matter; it is about protecting lives. 
 The Government of Nepal has taken steps to address acid-related crimes. Under the  Muluki Criminal Code ,  acid attacks  are punishable by law, carrying prison sentences and fines. Some rules require licenses and records for selling acid.  However, punishment after harm is not enough. Prevention is more important. In many shops, acid can still be bought easily without proper labelling or safety instructions. Laws are only effective if they are properly enforced. 
 There must be a complete ban on selling acid in bottles that look like drinking water. Acid should only be sold in strong, non-transparent containers with clear danger signs and warning labels. The packaging should be child-proof and easily recognisable as hazardous. Shops that sell acid must be registered and inspected regularly. If they break the rules, strict action should be taken. 
 Local governments, ward offices, and consumer protection authorities must monitor chemical sales regularly. Market inspections should not focus only on food safety, but they should also give equal attention to dangerous chemicals.  Traders must be trained to understand the risks and their responsibility in keeping customers safe. 
 Public awareness is equally important. People need to understand how dangerous acid is. It is not just another liquid. It can burn, destroy tissues, and permanently damage a person’s body within seconds. One small mistake can destroy someone’s health, mental well-being, financial stability, and overall quality of life. 
 A bottle that looks like water should never contain something that can ruin a life. When safety measures are simple and feasible, carelessness becomes unacceptable. One proper container, one clear label, and one strict inspection can save a life. Nepal should not wait for another tragedy to occur. Safety should never depend on luck. Prevention must be our priority.

"Air pollution worsens in Kathmandu Valley","File: A view of the Kathmandu valley 
 Kathmandu, February 17 
 Air pollution levels in the Kathmandu Valley have increased, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) rising from 178 on Monday afternoon to 191 today. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) standard, an AQI between 151 and 200 is considered unhealthy, meaning everyone may begin to experience health effects, while sensitive groups may face more serious impacts. 
 With the current AQI level, Kathmandu has been ranked the third most polluted city in the world. New Delhi tops the list with an AQI of 229, followed by Lahore at 203. 
 Director General of the Department of Environment, Gyan Raj Subedi, said pollution levels may rise further if rainfall does not occur. The prolonged dry spell has significantly contributed to the deteriorating air quality. He urged stakeholders to adopt sustainable and environmentally friendly measures to mitigate the impact. 
 Environmental expert Barsha Parajuli attributed the worsening pollution to the growing number of vehicles, emissions from diesel and petrol engines, dust from ongoing road and infrastructure projects, forest fires, and the continued lack of rainfall. She warned that failure to control the situation promptly could make it more difficult to manage in the future. 
 An AQI above 200 is considered very unhealthy, posing serious risks to public health.

"Daunne Road expansion delayed repeatedly; travellers face hardship (Photos)","Nawalparasi, February 17  
 Road upgrading works are ongoing at a rapid pace along the Daunne section of the Butwal–Narayangadh road. The 113-kilometre Narayangadh–Butwal road section was divided into two parts for expansion. The eastern section from Narayangadh to Daunne (65 km) and the western section from Daunne to Butwal (49 km) were awarded to China Construction Pvt. Ltd. for Rs 16.99 billion. 
 However, the work has yet to be completed. Concrete paving and other construction activities are currently underway. The cost of the Gaindakot–Daunne section is Rs 9.13 billion, while the Daunne–Butwal section costs Rs 7.86 billion. 
 The prolonged delay in completing the road expansion has caused hardship to the general public. During the monsoon, the road becomes muddy, and in winter, dust creates serious problems for travellers along the route. The project aims to expand the existing two-lane road into four lanes along 29 kilometres, six lanes across 70 kilometres in market areas, and three lanes along 13 kilometres in the Daunne stretch. 
 The expansion work began on 8 Chait 2075 BS and was scheduled for completion by Shrawan 22, 2079 BS. However, it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, tree-cutting issues, delays in relocating electricity poles and drinking water pipelines, local obstructions, labour problems, and issues related to the contractor company. 
 The deadline was first extended until Shrawan 11, 2080 BS, then until Shrawan 8, 2081 BS for the second time, and finally extended for a third time until Shrawan 8, 2082 BS.

"Nepal ranks second globally in EV sales","Kathmandu, February 17 
 Nepal has secured the second position in the world in terms of electric vehicle (EV) sales. 
 In 2025, Nepal ranked second globally for the highest share of electric cars sold, with Norway in Europe taking the top position. Norway became the world leader in 2025 after 97 per cent of its new car sales were electric, while Nepal stood in second place. 
 Globally, Nepal ranked second as EVs accounted for an estimated 73 per cent of total new car sales in 2025, compared to just 8 per cent in 2019. 
 A comparison between 2019 and 2025 shows a sharp rise in EV sales in Nepal during this period. 
 China remains the largest EV market in absolute numbers, with more than 13 million electric vehicles sold in 2025. In 2019, electric vehicles were still considered a niche purchase in most countries, accounting for only a single-digit share of new car sales. By 2025, EVs had become dominant in many markets. In Norway, EVs accounted for 97 per cent of new car sales, meaning nearly every new car sold was electric. 
 Many other countries have crossed the 50 per cent threshold, and in China, EVs made up more than half of all new car sales in the world’s largest automobile market. 
 According to data from the International Energy Agency and Ember, EVs include both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. 
 Compared to 2019, Nepal increased its EV sales share by 61 percentage points by 2025. During the same period, Finland and Denmark also surpassed 50 per cent. 
 In percentage terms, Norway leads globally, while China dominates in absolute numbers. EV sales in China are estimated to have reached more than 13.2 million units in 2025, representing 53 per cent of new car sales. This makes China the largest EV market by volume and one of the fastest-growing by market share. 
 In the United States, EV sales accounted for 10 per cent of total new car sales in 2025, equivalent to around 1.6 million units. European markets have also seen significant growth in EV sales. 
 Belgium reached 43 per cent, the Netherlands 56 per cent, Portugal 37 per cent, and the United Kingdom 33 per cent, all showing notable increases compared to 2019.

"What Nepali students must learn before leaving home","Studying abroad is a great opportunity to gain new perspectives, knowledge, and experiences. However, the journey can also be expensive and challenging. Currently, there is a strong trend among students from Nepal to study abroad. At the same time, we frequently hear stories of students facing difficulties in foreign countries due to a lack of practical skills. 
 By learning some useful skills before going abroad, students can not only succeed academically but also benefit in their future careers. 
 In this article, we discuss essential skills that students planning to study abroad should learn, categorized into language, personal development, cultural, technical, professional, and legal skills. 
 Language skills 
 The first and most important skill for studying abroad is language. In many countries, English is widely used, but in some places, learning the local language may be necessary. The more proficient we are in the language, the better we can perform academically. Having a proficiency in the local language can also increase job opportunities. 
 Since English is taught at the school level in Nepal, students may not need as much additional effort as with other languages. Many institutions across Nepal teach English, and it can also be learned through the internet. However, for studying abroad, passing English proficiency tests (such as IELTS, TOEFL) is not enough. Students must be able to communicate in daily conversations, understand lectures, and write assignments effectively. 
 Online courses (such as Duolingo, Coursera, and YouTube) can help improve language skills. For example, students going to countries like the United States or Australia may initially struggle to understand local accents. Therefore, practising by listening to different accents from the destination country is helpful. 
 If planning to study in countries such as Germany, France, or Japan, learning German, French, or Japanese becomes important. It makes daily life easier. Without language knowledge, even simple tasks like grocery shopping, using public transport, or making local friends can become challenging. 
 Personal development and self-management skills 
 Living alone in a foreign country requires independence and responsibility. In Nepal, family support is often available, but abroad, students must handle everything themselves. Many young people who have not done household tasks in Nepal struggle after moving abroad. Therefore, it is wise to develop the habit of managing personal responsibilities before leaving. 
 Time management is another crucial skill. Students must balance studies, part-time jobs, household chores, and leisure activities. Without proper time management, daily life can become chaotic. 
 Budget management is equally important, as living abroad is usually expensive. Students should learn to track expenses, save money, and reduce unnecessary spending. Preparing a monthly budget plan using tools like Mint or Excel before leaving Nepal can be very helpful. 
 Basic domestic skills such as cooking, doing laundry, and cleaning are also essential. Nepali food may not always be available abroad, so learning to cook simple Nepali and local dishes is beneficial. It helps maintain good health and saves money. 
 Stress management is another important soft skill. Students may experience loneliness or culture shock while living abroad. Practices such as meditation, yoga, or journaling can help manage stress effectively. 
 Cultural skills 
 Studying abroad also means understanding and adopting new cultures, traditions, and values. Students should learn about the customs, food habits, and social norms of their destination country. For example, in many Western countries, personal space is highly valued, whereas in Nepali society is more collective. Reading cultural guides online can be useful. 
 Building and maintaining relationships is another important skill. Students can expand their networks through platforms like LinkedIn or by participating in events.  
 Technical and digital skills 
 In today’s digital age, technical knowledge is essential. Universities abroad heavily use online resources. Therefore, students should have a good knowledge of Microsoft Office, Google Workspace, or Adobe Suite. Skills such as making presentations, conducting basic data analysis, or having foundational coding knowledge are highly valued. 
 Familiarity with academic journals, plagiarism-checking tools, cybersecurity awareness, and remote learning platforms can also make academic life easier. 
 Professional skills 
 The main goal of studying abroad is often to build a strong career. Therefore, students should develop professional skills alongside their studies. These include writing an internationally standard CV, updating profiles on professional platforms like LinkedIn, and preparing for interviews. 
 Students should also understand work regulations in the host country, whether for internships or part-time jobs. Developing skills such as customer service, teamwork, and leadership is important. Additionally, students must be aware of visa regulations, health insurance policies, and emergency procedures in their destination country. 
 Legal knowledge 
 Understanding the laws of the host country is mandatory. Without proper legal awareness, students may unknowingly get into legal trouble. Something considered normal in Nepal might be a legal offence in another country. 
 It is also important to know local laws related to the specific area where one will live. Sometimes educational consultancies or agents provide this information. Students can also research online or ask acquaintances who are already living in that country. 
 Preparing with these essential skills before studying abroad can make the transition smoother, reduce difficulties, and significantly improve both academic success and future career prospects.

"Pashupati bids farewell to Naga Babas today with Rs 3 million dakshina allocation","Kathmandu, February 17 
 Naga Babas and other sadhus who arrived at Pashupatinath for Mahashivaratri will be bid farewell today with offerings and dakshina (monetary donations). It has been a tradition for the Guthi Sansthan and the Pashupati Area Development Trust to bid farewell to the sadhus on Falgun Krishna Aunsi, after they arrive on Falgun Krishna Ekadashi for the festival. 
 According to former Deputy Administrator of the Guthi Sansthan, Deepak Bahadur Pandey, who has coordinated the farewell of sadhus multiple times, the tradition began in 1831 BS after Jagat Jung, the eldest son of Jung Bahadur, established the Jagananda Prakasheshwor Guthi. 
 The Sansthan has allocated around Rs 3 million for the farewell. Red, blue, white, yellow, and green cards were distributed to Naga Babas and other sadhus on the day of their arrival for dakshina. Dakshina will be provided according to their level, Pandey said. The Sansthan has also increased the amount for Naga Babas and sadhus who have come from outside Nepal to help them reach the nearest border. 
 More than 4,000 sadhus from outside Nepal are currently staying at Gorakhnath Math in Pashupati, Ramchandra Temple across Aryaghat, Bhasmeshwar Akhada, Nirmala Akhada, and various other locations within the Pashupati premises. Different sects of sadhus are staying at each site, according to Shridhar Sapkota, Treasurer of the Pashupati Area Development Trust. 
 “In the past, Naga Babas and sadhus were fed at Pashupati and then bid farewell with dakshina from Kalamochan Ghat in Thapathali. Since those killed in the Kot Massacre were cremated at Kalamochan Ghat, it was believed that bidding farewell to a large number of sadhus from there during Shivaratri would bring peace to the departed souls. That tradition has now been discontinued. Currently, Naga Babas and sadhus are bid farewell from the western main gate of Pashupati,” he said. 
 Similarly, Naga Babas and sadhus staying at the Bairagi Akhada, Udasi Akhada, Sanyasi Akhada, and Nath Akhada at Kalamochan Ghat in Thapathali for Mahashivaratri will also be bid farewell today with donations, the Sansthan stated. They will be sent off from Kalamochan Ghat. 
 After the implementation of the Transparent Offerings and Worship Management Regulation at Pashupatinath Temple on Chaitra 26, 2068 BS, the Pashupati Area Development Trust began providing dakshina and meals to Naga Babas and sadhus from Mahashivaratri 2069 BS onward. 
 “The Trust has prepared to provide dakshina ranging from Rs 5,001 to Rs 101,” said Shila Pant, member of the Trust’s Board and coordinator of the Sadhus Service and Religious Program Management Subcommittee. “The Trust will provide Rs 5,001 to 20 sadhus; Rs 1,001 to 200 sadhus; Rs 701 to 1,000 sadhus; Rs 501 to 1,000 sadhus; Rs 301 to 1,300 sadhus; Rs 201 to all jogis; and Rs 101 to all those sitting in line.” 
 She informed that the Trust has allocated Rs 800,000 for dakshina. The Trust is also preparing to bid farewell to the sadhus by offering them rudraksha beads collected at Pashupatinath throughout the year, along with the donations. 
 Deputy Administrator Pandey said that 50,000 kilograms of firewood worth Rs 700,000 have been purchased to keep the sacred fires (dhuni) burning for five days inside the Pashupatinath Temple and four days outside during Mahashivaratri. 
 The Trust also stated that since the offerings were made transparent and deposited in the Trust’s donation boxes from 26 Chait 2068 BS, a total of Rs 150 million has been collected so far, to establish Pashupatinath Temple as a model temple in Nepal.

"Fire in sugarcane field in Siraha incurs damages worth over 10 million","Siraha, February 17 
 Sugarcane planted across 30 bigha of land in Siraha district was destroyed when a fire broke out and spread across the sugarcane field at Ghaletole at Lahan Municipality-13 in Siraha district on Monday noon.  
 According to preliminary police details, fire caused an estimated loss of around Rs 11.6 million to 25 local sugarcane farmers. DSP Kailash Rai, also the Chief of the Area Police Office, Lahan, shared that a police team was immediately deployed to the site after receiving information that the fire had erupted in the middle of the sugarcane plantation in the afternoon. DSP Rai further said that with the assistance of residents, the fire was prevented from spreading to nearby human settlements.  
 After the water jetting motor of the fire engine from the Lahan Municipality malfunctioned, a backup support was immediately sought from Golbazar Municipality, which completely extinguished the blaze after four hours of coordinated efforts among the security personnel, firemen and residents. Police suspect that the fire may have been caused by a discarded cigarette or bidi or possibly set intentionally, since it started from the middle of the sugarcane field. 
 An investigation has been launched into the incident. Farmer Ram Lakhan Mandal, expressing his distress, said that he had planned to sell the sugarcane to manage household expenses and repay loans. 
 “Even the investment has sunk,” he grieved, calling on the authorities to identify the culprits and bring them to book. He also demanded due compensation to farmers like him whose cash crop has been gutted by fire. Another victim, farmer Kapil Dev Yadav, also sought legal action against anyone found responsible. “Whoever has set fire to a sugarcane field has committed a crime against farmers,” he lamented.  
 According to him, sugarcane yields an average of 30 to 35 quintals per kattha with adequate fertiliser and irrigation facilities. He mentioned that when sold to the sugar industry, farmers receive Rs 620 per quintal along with a government subsidy of Rs 70, totalling Rs 690 per quintal. Based on this estimate, around 18,000 quintals of sugarcane are believed to have been destroyed by fire, putting the projected loss at approximately Rs 12.42 million.

"Winless Nepal to aim for redemption against Scotland in final group game","Kathmandu, February 17  
 Nepal, already eliminated from the group stage of the  2026 ICC T20 World Cup , will face Scotland in their final match today.  
 The Group C match between Nepal and Scotland will begin at 7:15 pm Nepali time at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. 
 Since both Nepal and Scotland have already been knocked out of the group stage before playing their final game, Nepal will be aiming to end their World Cup campaign on a positive note with a win today. 
 Nepal, having played all three of its matches at the Wankhede Stadium, suffered defeats in each. They lost their opening match to England by four runs, followed by a heavy 10-wicket defeat to debutants Italy. In their third match, Nepal was  beaten by the West Indies  by nine wickets, resulting in their exit from the group stage. 
 Scotland, on the other hand, began their T20 World Cup journey with a victory over Italy in their first match. However, after losing their next two games, Scotland were also eliminated from the group stage before their final match, following England’s win over Italy. 
 As the only winless team in Group C, Nepal will be targeting a victory over Scotland in their last match to give their supporters something to cheer about. 
  Nepal played all their matches at the Wankhede Stadium, completing three games at the same venue. Scotland, who qualified at the last moment in place of Bangladesh, played their first three matches at Eden Gardens in Kolkata before travelling to Mumbai. Despite playing at a single venue, Nepal has not been able to capitalise on any home-ground familiarity. 
 Nepal defeated Hong Kong and Afghanistan in the 2014 World Cup held in Bangladesh, but since then, they have failed to register a win in the next two World Cups. As a result, Nepal are still searching for their first T20 World Cup victory in 12 years. 
 Nepal and Scotland have faced each other twice in T20 Internationals so far, with both teams winning one match each.

"Tourism in transition: The evolution of Nepal’s policy, purpose and promise","File: Tourists viewing a mountain range in Nepal 
 Tourism has long been one of Nepal’s economic anchors, shaping livelihoods in the hills, plains, and cities alike. It creates jobs, brings in foreign exchange, and keeps many rural communities connected to national progress. But tourism has never been a fixed story. It shifts with political change, global conditions, new technologies, and the expectations of each generation. Looking back to the early 1970s, we see a country learning from setbacks, broadening its ambition, and slowly redefining what tourism can mean beyond picturesque landscapes. 
 Nepal’s formal tourism journey began with the  1972 Tourism Master Plan , drafted with support from the Government of Germany. It provided the first structured roadmap, identifying trekking, mountaineering, wildlife, arts, and heritage as the country’s core offerings, and outlining the institutions needed to guide them.  
 The Tourism Act of 1978 then brought order to a growing sector by setting licensing rules and regulating mountaineering, while the Nepal Tourism Board Act of 1997 established a public–private model that professionalised marketing and gave industry stakeholders a seat at the table. By the early 2000s, Nepal had a clearer identity, stronger institutions, and the basic framework of a modern  tourism  economy. 
 The policy maturation era: 2000–2024 
 From 2000 onwards, Nepal moved from building foundations to reshaping intent. The Tourism Policy 2065 (2008/09) widened the lens beyond mountaineering and monuments. It helped push community-based tourism, sustainability, gender inclusion and rural opportunity into the mainstream. The Homestay Working Procedure 2067 (2010) then turned a grassroots practice into a regulated, nation-defining product anchoring visitor spending where it matters most: in households, women’s groups, cooperatives and village businesses.  
 Ambition leapt higher with Tourism Vision 2020, which sought scale and new connectivity. Progress was dented by the 2015 earthquake and global headwinds, but the intent mattered: it placed aviation capacity, regional destination hubs and private investment at the centre of the growth story. 
 The National Tourism Strategic Plan (2016–2025) tried to tie it all together, targets, costing, human capital, product diversification, quality and a framework for recovery. By 2024, Nepal’s tourism governance was more mature, more inclusive and more data-aware than ever before, even as implementation gaps persisted in coordination, aviation reform and digital systems. 
 A new chapter: Tourism policy 2082 (2025) 
 
 File 
 With endorsement from the Upper House, the Tourism Policy 2082 arrives not as an incremental update but as a course correction for the federal era. It frames a clear national identity Unique Tourism Destination: Nepal,” and then builds the operating system to make that identity real.  
 The first strength is federal alignment with accountability. A National Tourism Council is tasked to bring federal, provincial and local tiers into one cadence. This is how policy becomes roads, signage, rescue readiness, heritage upkeep and destination management on the ground. It is also how air gateways, border posts, provincial circuits and municipal bylaws stop working at cross-purposes and start serving a single visitor journey. 
 The second strength is digital transformation with measurement. Tourism today is searched, booked and judged online before a guest has even packed a bag. The policy’s focus on e-visa expansion, integrated data systems and a Tourism Satellite Account is the difference between flying blind and flying by instruments. With TSA-grade evidence, Nepal can finally set realistic targets for length of stay, spending, jobs and seasonality and can course-correct quickly when shocks hit.  
 Third, the policy confronts connectivity and capacity. Encouraging private participation in airport development and upgrading regional airports signals a practical response to chronic bottlenecks. If Pokhara and Lumbini are to become true international gateways, they need governance models and route-development programs that match the ambition of the infrastructure. The policy points in that direction. 
 Fourth, it rebalances the product portfolio. Nepal will always be the world’s address for trekking and mountaineering, but growth must also come from wellness and Ayurveda, spiritual and cultural journeys, conservation-anchored eco-tourism, homestays that deliver authentic immersion, and a renewed push for MICE where the country has a natural advantage in retreats, learning programs and off-sites. The policy treats diversification not as a slogan but as risk management and value creation. 
 Fifth, sustainability is not a footnote but the organising principle. Climate change is already redrawing the map of risk in the Himalaya. The policy’s insistence on green infrastructure, responsible practices and environmental adaptation is both moral sense and market sense. Future travellers will pay for destinations that can prove they are protecting what they sell. 
 Finally, the policy addresses quality and trust, the soft power that determines reputation. It empowers standards, professionalises the service chain and opens the door to enforceable norms across guiding, safety, hygiene and digital behaviour. This is where the new policy must be unrelenting. Nepal’s brand will not be rebuilt by posters but by predictable, high-quality experiences and the confidence that what is promised online is delivered on the ground.

 On rebuilding trust in the digital age: Nepal has been bruised by online scams, rumour cycles and influencer theatrics. The remedy is not to shout louder but to be cleaner: verified operator registries; clear recourse for digital misrepresentation; rapid-response fact-checking; brand-safe partnerships; and a single national content spine that embassies, diaspora groups, airlines and the private sector can all amplify. A “Rebrand Nepal” effort must be less about taglines and more about systems that keep the brand from being hijacked. 
 On closing the execution gap: Past policies stumbled not for lack of ideas but for lack of follow-through. Tourism Policy 2082 will stand or fall on disciplined implementation: fixing the airport management and route development; pushing service quality and skills; installing modern data rails; empowering municipalities to manage crowding, waste and behaviour; and ensuring every province has a bankable, climate-aware destination plan. When the centre sets standard,s and the local level owns delivery, results compound. 
 The way forward 
 From the 1972 Master Plan to the 2025 Policy, Nepal has moved from blueprint to brand, from product to experience, from centralised control to cooperative federalism. The new policy offers more than hope; it offers a working method for turning identity into income while protecting culture and nature. If we execute with integrity and speed, cleaning the digital ecosystem, aligning institutions, incentivising quality and measuring what matters, tourism can shift from volatility to resilience, from seasonal cycles to year- round value. 
 The vision is clear. The momentum is here. What remains is the discipline to make promises visible— to travellers in their search bars, to communities in their incomes, and to the nation in its balance sheet. Nepal stands at an inflexion point. With the right actions, Tourism Policy 2082 can guide us to a stronger, smarter and more durable tourism future.

"Nepal crash out of T20 World Cup 2026 after third straight defeat","By A Staff Reporter,Kathmandu, Feb. 16: Nepal’s captain Rohit Paudel on Sunday admitted that batting failures were the chief reason behind his side’s exit from the group stage of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026. Nepal bowed out of their third World Cup campaign after suffering three straight defeats in Group C. Their latest loss came against two‑time champions West Indies, who cruised to a nine‑wicket victory at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.  “As a batting unit, we failed again. We are missing out on partnerships. We are getting stands of 20 or 30 but not stretching them,” Paudel said. “Those of us getting starts are not converting them into big scores. Those are the areas where we need to improve.” Put in to bat first, Nepal were restricted to 133 for eight in their 20 overs. They slumped to 73 for six in 15 overs before vice‑captain Dipendra Singh Airee and Sompal Kami carried them past three figures. Airee and Kami added 54 for the seventh wicket before Airee holed out to Jason Holder in the 19th over, leaving Nepal 127 for seven. Airee’s fluent 58 from 47 balls, with three fours and three sixes, was his 11th T20 international fifty and made him only the second Nepali player to reach a half‑century in a World Cup. Subash Khakurel was the first, against Afghanistan in Bangladesh in 2014.  Paudel praised his deputy’s effort: “He took his time and played very well. He accelerated at the end, but early on when the wicket was difficult, he managed to wait for his opportunity and then cashed in. We all need to learn from that.” Kami, making his first appearance of this tournament, contributed an unbeaten 26 from 15 balls. With it, he became the first player to represent Nepal in three T20 World Cups, having featured in 2014 and 2024. He replaced Sher Malla in the line‑up.  Reflecting on the campaign, Kami said: “We know that as a team we can perform better than this. But we failed to give our hundred per cent in the field. Especially, the loss against Italy was very hard to digest. We lost against South Africa, Bangladesh and England, but against Italy was very heartbreaking.” Nepal’s innings began poorly, losing opener Kushal Bhurtel for a single in the first over. Paudel followed for five in the fourth. Asif Sheikh (11), Aarif Sheikh (2), Lokesh Bam (13) and Gulshan Jha (11) all departed cheaply, leaving Airee and Kami to mount resistance. Holder returned figures of four for 27 and was named player of the match. The West Indies chased down the target with ease, finishing on 134 for one in 15.2 overs.  Captain Shai Hope struck an unbeaten 61 from 44 balls, including five boundaries and three sixes, while Shimron Hetmyer added 46 not out from 32 deliveries. The pair shared an unbroken stand of 91 for the second wicket. Brandon King contributed 17 before falling to Nandan Yadav in the sixth over. With three successive wins, West Indies became the first team to qualify for the Super Eights, while Nepal became the second side eliminated after earlier defeats to England and Italy. West Indies lead Group C with six points, England are second with four, and Scotland and Italy each have two. Nepal remain winless, with only Tuesday’s match against Scotland left to play, a contest now reduced to a battle for pride. Coach Stuart Law had warned on Saturday that social media was affecting the players’ performance. Paudel echoed his view, urging his squad to block out external noise. “If players listen to it, it will be hard for them to perform. When the team is losing, it is vital to keep everyone positive, and we are trying to do that,” he said.

"Prime Minister directs to move forward with Kathmandu-Terai Madhes fast track project","Photo: PM's Office By TRN Online, Kathmandu, Feb.17: Prime Minister Sushila Karki has directed to proceed with alternative planning by putting aside the debate of over Khokana, the departure point of the Kathmandu-Terai Madhes Fast Track. Prime Minister Karki has given this directive in the context of concerns being expressed by the local community regarding the impact on religious and cultural heritage and beliefs in Khokana, Lalitpur. She put forward the plan of the alternative route in the discussion held in the office of Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers held today.  PM Kakri had inspected the under construction Kathmandu-Terai Madhes Expressway on January 27. On that occasion, she stated that the concerns of local people must be taken seriously while carrying out development and construction works. She also emphasized that this national pride project should be completed at the earliest, even if it requires changing the starting point. Today, Prime Minister Karki invited Finance Minister Rameshwor Khanal, Law Minister Anil Kumar Sinha, Physical Infrastructure and Transport Minister Madhav Chaulagain, National Planning Commission Vice Chair Prakash Kumar Shrestha, Nepal Army Chief Ashok Raj Sigdel, and officials related to the fast track project and secretaries of the concerned ministries for a discussion. On the occasion, a briefing was held on behalf of the Nepal Army on the progress made in the project so far, problems, and expectations from the government.  “There should be no unnecessary delay in development work. Disputes should be resolved as much as possible. We should find alternatives and move forward,” Prime Minister Karki said.  She directed that the Detailed Project Report (DPR) be revised and that the starting point be determined from a mutually agreeable location instead of Khokana.

"Nepal is going to be a hub for global cinema: Bham","Renowned Nepali filmmaker Min Bahadur Bham has been selected as a jury member for the Berlin International Film Festival 2026, along with six other colleagues chosen from among thousands of filmmakers worldwide. With this achievement, Director Bham has become the first Nepali filmmaker to serve as a jury member at this world-renowned festival. Bham will share the jury stage with Bay Duna from South Korea, Shivendra Singh Dungarpur from India, Ewa Puszczynska from Poland, and the internationally acclaimed Wim Wenders. German filmmaker Wenders will serve as the Chairman of the 2026 International Jury panel. The film Sambhala, directed by Bham, competed in the main category at the Berlinale Festival in 2025. Raman Paudel from The Rising Nepal interviewed Bham, focusing on his experiences and the future possibilities for Nepali cinema.  You produced the film Bansuli as your first project. How do you recall your entire journey from Bansuli to becoming a Berlinale Jury member? Is this your topmost achievement, or is there more to achieve ? Honestly, I never thought of it as the biggest moment in my filmmaking career. I take it simply as a step. As you mentioned, I started my journey in 2012 with Bansuli, and now it has been more than a decade as an artist and a filmmaker. It is a long journey, and in fact, the journey never ends as long as I continue to create films. I am not in the mood or position to say that this is the peak of my career. I still have a long way to go. Even if I someday go to other festivals as a jury member, or present my own films, or even attend the Oscars, I truly believe that these are just milestones in a long journey as a filmmaker. I never get overly excited because of such success. I believe in hard work and karma. I am always more aware of my internal growth during this long journey. I would not be disappointed if I could not go to Berlin, and I would not be overly excited if I went to the Oscars. These are just part of the game. I see them as simple incidents—like a bus stop during a long journey on a highway.  A huge number of audience members and filmmakers, including those in the global film industry, expect more from you. How do you feel about the challenges ? There are always two kinds of challenges that I foresee. The first is external—like the expectations of the industry, the audience, film critics, and fellow filmmakers. That is very normal. I always respect those opinions. But I am even more aware of the internal challenges and motivations. That is more interesting to me than external expectations. Of course, I respect whatever people expect from me in the future. However, what truly matters to me is not only my growth as a filmmaker but also as a human being. I am more concerned about my internal growth—my spiritual growth. That is the real challenge for me.  What additional factor contributed to you becoming a jury member ? Officially, they never explained why they chose the other jury members. It is probably based on their own protocol, structure, and ideology regarding whom to invite. If you look at the previous examples of the Berlinale, they have mostly invited actors as jury presidents, and often women. This time as well, among the seven jury members, the majority were women. The Berlinale always focuses on inclusion and minority communities. They try to represent different regions—Africa, Asia, transgender filmmakers, and other marginalised communities. My previous film was screened in Berlin, which likely made a strong impression. They also aim to maintain continuous relationships with filmmakers and film industries globally. That is one of the strengths of the festival. A few days ago, I read an interview with the Berlin festival director. She mentioned that from 2012 to 2026, seven Nepali films have been screened at the Berlinale. The first was Highway by Deepak Rauniyar. Two years ago, it was Sambhala. And now, they invited me as a jury member. This shows that they truly want to be part of the growth of the Nepali film industry. They do not want to lose this momentum or break this relationship. I am optimistic that they are paying more attention to Nepali cinema. In the coming years, they may give more space to Nepali filmmakers or invite more filmmakers to serve as jurors in different sections. This is a very important relationship that filmmakers, the industry, and even our government and Film Development Board should understand. I also want to add that Nepali audiences have very high visual literacy compared to many other countries. Young readers in Nepal are reading Paulo Coelho, Haruki Murakami, Khalil Gibran, and other global writers. They listen to Lady Gaga and Pink Floyd. There is still an audience for jazz, modern pop, and global hip-hop. We are very international in our tastes. The visual literacy of Nepali audiences is dynamic, and this is a positive sign for our future. Looking at the larger pattern of world cinema, the wave has shifted from Japan during the time of Akira Kurosawa, to India during Satyajit Ray, then to Iran during Abbas Kiarostami and Jafar Panahi, and recently to South Korea. Now, I believe the wave is moving toward Vietnam, largely due to supportive government policies, economic growth, and young filmmakers who dare to express their vulnerability. In that context, I believe Nepal is in a strong position within South Asia. I am optimistic and proud to say that after Vietnam, the next wave of world cinema could turn toward Nepal. Within a decade, Nepal could become a major hub in global cinema—if we are strategically aware and prepared to hold that position.  Some writers and activists criticised your film Kalopothi, saying it was dominated by a Western perspective and overlooked the Maoist Revolution. How do you respond ? I accept all kinds of criticism. I truly value criticism and take it as a compliment. However, to be honest, neither positive nor negative comments deeply affect me as an artist. Being a filmmaker means being human first. I have my own limitations. Naturally, my perspective, strength, and opinions will reflect in my films. That includes political beliefs, spiritual beliefs, and how I see life and nature. That is the beauty of being an artist. I create art not for the sake of making everyone happy, but to express my own truth.  You mentioned that you are not affected by external reactions. Is this because of your achievements or your belief in Buddhism ? Neither. It is not because of Buddhism, nor due to my film making or participation in major festivals. The beauty of being an artist is that the more success you achieve, the more grounded you become. That is the power of art. Of course, I respect my audience and value criticism. I respect journalists and critics. But the reason I say that praise or criticism does not affect me is because I want to remain internally light. I want to express my suffocations. I want to explore my vulnerability with courage.  Nabin Subba once said that we need to explore our own craft—from Thangka or the Mahabharata. Do you feel that challenge ? Yes, I am very close to Nabin Subba. We often discuss our history, tradition, culture, and artistic values. I deeply value these sources. They can be a great inspiration for young filmmakers. I always look toward spiritual, religious, and cultural elements when building narratives. For example, in Bansuli, the idea was inspired by Hindu mythology—where Lord Krishna never allowed the gopis to play the flute. These are elements we need to rediscover and reinterpret. That is very important for an artist.  You seem like a Buddhist monk, yet you are involved in politics and are also a powerful filmmaker. How do you manage all these roles ? First, let me clarify why I am involved in politics. It is not new for me. I have been involved since my student union days. I am not here to become Prime Minister or Home Minister. I do not carry such ambitions. I want to reform the art industry—cinema, theater, music, literature. I want to improve policies and create a better position for art and culture. Regarding spirituality, there is a saying that sometimes the most extreme or passionate individuals can achieve spiritual growth quickly because of that intensity. Contrast is powerful. The contrast between politics, cinema, and spirituality is something I enjoy. These three elements are interconnected. We just need to find the connecting points. For me, managing these roles is about understanding that they are not separate worlds—they are different expressions of the same inner search.

"No Kids In Campaigns","As the country edges closer to the House of Representatives elections, the Election Commission has issued a 64-point directive to the political parties, their candidates and others. One of them states that parties should not use children in election activities. The directive has clearly warned against using children in campaign rallies, slogan-chanting, poster distribution, and other partisan activities. The directive comes as a moral line that should never have been crossed in the first place. However, evidence shows otherwise. This moral line is often blurred in each election period. Despite the country’s constitutional provisions, child protection laws, and international treaty obligations, children continue to be conscripted into the political spectacle – from nomination rallies to post-election victory celebrations. Children’s presence is a concerning sign of the normalisation of child exploitation.   When children are employed to shout out political slogans, democracy begins to undermine its own moral foundations. The hypocrisy is glaring: Politicians speak endlessly about building politicians speak endlessly about building a bright future for the next generation, yet they simultaneously run campaign machinery that exploits children as props for political optics and emotional appeal. While there is nothing wrong with civic education and awareness, the line between education and mobilisation must be strictly policed. Educating children about democracy is a sound way to cultivate responsible citizenship.   Mobilising children for partisan politics is a sure way to undermine child protection. It is appropriate that civil society organisations and constitutional bodies have sounded the alarm against this trend. The need for an advisory that clearly prohibits any form of child participation in electioneering is not an overreaction. It is a necessary response to a political culture that sometimes confuses visibility with legitimacy. Around 115 reported incidents of election code violations involving children during the last local election should have been a wake-up call. Instead, it seems that the problem continues, and promises are not enough.   The participation of children at the election seems to be accepted in silence at the grassroots level. Children passing out flyers or shouting slogans may seem harmless. However, behind the scenes, there is coercion, subtle intimidation, or social pressure. Children do not have the capacity to give informed consent to political engagement. They are likely to be conscripted by adults who know better. The elections will be watched by dozens of national and international organisations. However, monitoring needs to go beyond procedural compliance to ethical diligence. A free and fair election also means protecting the vulnerable from political manipulation.   Political parties should understand that if they are truly committed to democratic ideals. They should campaign on their ideas, plan, policies and performance, not on how well they can rally schoolchildren for a photo. Including child rights in their party manifesto would be a great start, but this needs to be reflected in their actual behaviour on the ground. The move of the Election Commission is welcome, but its effectiveness will be in its proper implementation. Complaint procedures need to be accessible and responsive. There need to be consequences for violations that will prevent recurrence. Otherwise, the cycle of promise and violation will continue.

"Nepal Women fall to UAE, exit semi‑final race","By A Staff Reporter,Kathmandu, Feb. 16: Captain Puja Mahato and Samjhana Khadka struck half‑centuries, but their efforts went in vain as Nepal’s women’s team slumped to a second consecutive defeat at the Women’s Asia Cup Rising Stars 2026 in Bangkok, Thailand. Nepal went down by 18 runs to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Sunday, having lost their opening fixture to Pakistan ‘A’ by 30 runs. Consecutive defeats have ended Nepal’s hopes of reaching the semi‑finals, leaving them bottom of Group A without a point. UAE, with two wins from two matches, lead the group on four points. Pakistan ‘A’ are second with two points from one win, while India ‘A’ are also yet to register a victory. Chasing a daunting target of 190, Nepal finished on 171 for five in their 20 overs. Khadka and Mahato both reached fifties but could not avert defeat.  Khadka made 58 from 39 balls with 11 boundaries before being caught by Rinitha Rajith off Heena Hotchandani. It was her second career half‑century. Mahato compiled 53 from 35 deliveries, hitting eight fours and a six, before also falling to Hotchandani. It was her fourth T20I fifty. Fellow opener Bindu Rawal added 16 from 18 balls with three boundaries before being dismissed by Indhuja Nandakumar.  Sita Rana Magar remained unbeaten on 22, while Roma Thapa was not out on nine. Kabita Kunwar (7) and Rubi Poddar (4) departed cheaply. Earlier, Nepal had won the toss and opted to field at the Terdthai Cricket Ground in Bangkok. UAE posted 189 for four in their 20 overs, powered by a superb century from captain Esha Ojha. She struck 125 from 63 balls, including 14 fours and nine sixes, before being run out by Poddar off Riya Sharma’s delivery. Hotchandani contributed an unbeaten 45. Rajith managed four before falling lbw to Kunwar, while opener Theertha Satish was dismissed for a duck. For Nepal, Manisha Upadhyay claimed two wickets and Kunwar one. Nepal will face India ‘A’ in their final group match on Tuesday. The Asia Cup features eight teams divided into two groups: Nepal, India ‘A’, Pakistan ‘A’ and UAE in Group A; hosts Thailand, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Sri Lanka in Group B.

"12 militants, 11 security personnel killed in check post attack in NW Pakistan","Security personnel stand guard in Bajaur district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Photo: APF File ISLAMABAD, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) : At least 12 militants and 11 security personnel were killed in a terrorist attack on a security check post in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the military said on Tuesday. The militants attempted to attack a joint check post of security forces and law enforcement agencies in Bajaur district of the province on late Monday, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the media wing of the Pakistani Army, said in a statement.  The attackers tried to breach the security of the check post, but the security personnel responded swiftly and effectively, foiling the attempt and killing 12 militants during an exchange of fire, the statement added.  However, in the ensuing violence, an explosive-laden vehicle was rammed into the perimeter wall of the check post, causing a powerful blast that led to the collapse of part of the infrastructure, the ISPR said. As a result of the explosion, 11 security personnel were killed, while nearby civilian residential buildings were also damaged, killing a girl and injuring seven other civilians, according to the statement. Security forces have launched a clearance operation in the area to eliminate any remaining militants, the ISPR said.

"Nepal sign off from T20 World Cup with win","Photo: Bikash Dware/TRN By Pramod Joshi, Kathmandu, Feb. 18: Nepal signed off from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 in style, sealing a seven-wicket victory over Scotland at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Tuesday. It was Nepal’s first World Cup win in 12 years, having last tasted success against Hong Kong and Afghanistan in their maiden appearance at the 2014 edition in Bangladesh. They went winless in their second campaign in 2024, co-hosted by the USA and West Indies. Batting first, Scotland posted 170 for seven in their 20 overs. Opener Michael Jones top-scored with a fluent 71 off 45 balls, supported by George Munsey (27) and Brandon McMullen (25). For Nepal, Sompal Kami – the only player to feature in all three of their World Cup campaigns – was the pick of the bowlers with three wickets.  Nandan Yadav claimed two, while captain Rohit Paudel and Kushal Bhurtel chipped in with one apiece. Backed by a vocal crowd of Nepali supporters, the Rhinos chased down the 171 target in 19.3 overs, losing just three wickets. Openers Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh gave Nepal a flying start with a 74-run stand. Bhurtel struck six sixes in his 43 off 35 balls before falling in the 10th over, while Sheikh contributed 33 from 27 deliveries. Captain Paudel departed for 16 in the 14th over, but vice-captain Dipendra Singh Airee steadied the innings with a blistering unbeaten half-century. Airee smashed three sixes and four boundaries in his 50 off just 23 balls – his second successive fifty of the tournament after his knock against the West Indies. He was ably supported by Gulshan Jha, who remained not out on 24 from 17 balls. Michael Leask was Scotland’s most successful bowler, taking all three Nepali wickets. Player of the Match Airee hailed the fans and underlined the importance of the win: “Thanks to the fans.  In the last World Cup we didn’t win a single match, so this is very important for us. One of my best innings. The England match was a learning experience – this is good for us.” Captain Paudel echoed the sentiment, praising his side’s death bowling and composure.  “Dipendra led the way. To restrict them to 170, our death bowling was great. We focused more on dot balls than wickets. Dipendra and Gulshan won the game for us. We kept our nerves calm – both bowlers and batters. We learned a lot from the England game.” Nepal were drawn in Group C alongside two-time champions England, the West Indies, debutants Italy and late entrants Scotland. Despite a spirited four-run defeat to England in their opener, Nepal’s campaign unravelled with a heavy 10-wicket loss to Italy and a nine-wicket defeat to the West Indies, ending their hopes of reaching the Super Eights. The win against Scotland, though a dead rubber, restored pride and gave their fans something to cheer as Nepal concluded their third World Cup appearance.

"Yarsagumba collector found crashed Tara Air plane tracking fuel smell :: Prashanna Pokharel :: Setopati","A youth from Badigaun Rural Municipality 7 of Baglung, who is in Mustang to collect yarsagumba (caterpillar fungus) found the crashed Tara Air Twin Otter plane Monday morning. 
 Bishal Gharti Magar was staying around Sanosware area in Thasang-2 of Mustang district along with friends since the third week of April. He was collecting yarsagumba in the area even on Sunday. 
 “We felt as if a plane flew right above our head. There was a loud noise shortly after. We talked among us whether the plane hit something,” Gharti Magar told Setopati. “But it was cloudy and we could not see the hills.” 
 He added that his villagers called him later to inform that a Tara Air plane has gone missing. “We searched the plane until Sunday evening feeling we can find it but to no avail,” he stated. “We have erected a tent in this area. We woke up at five in the morning and left to search the plane after drinking tea. We reached the hill above after walking for about an hour. There are three of us. Two of the friends went further uphill while I went downhill. I could smell something like diesel after walking a little downhill. I found debris of the plane after I moved toward the source of the smell feeling the plane may have crashed there. I saw body parts scattered.” 
 He told Setopati that he then called the husband of his sister in the village and informed about finding the crash site. “He apparently informed the police. The police called me in a while and I sent photos and video of the crash site after they asked me to send the same.” 
 He said that the plane seemed to have first hit something and again crashed with another thing. “No injured person was seen at the site. No one was found alive,” he went on. “The bodies were not in a proper condition while the plane has also been broken into pieces.” 
 
 He added that two policemen and another person first reached the spot after he located the crash site. 
 Chief District officer (CDO) of Mustang Netra Prasad Sharma told Setopati that Gharti Magar first found the plane and sent photos of the crash site. 
 The plane flown by Captain Prabhakar Ghimire was carrying 22 persons including three crew members and 19 passengers. The passengers included 13 Nepalis, four Indians and two Germans. 
 It was flying at an altitude of 12,825 feet when it lost contact at 10:07 in the morning, according to Flightradar data.","1","Setopati"
